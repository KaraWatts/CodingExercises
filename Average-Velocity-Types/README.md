# Instructions
Write a method that takes in an array of positions over time and the total change in time and return the average velocity of the entire trip. Time will always be greater than 0.

Average Velocity = (change in position) / (change in time)
Change in position = last position - first position

**Examples**

```js
avgVel([0, 4, 6], 10) = 0.6
avgVel([3, 2, 7], 4) = 1
```
