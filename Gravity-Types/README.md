# Instructions

You are an astronaut standing on the newly discovered Planet X and you need to calculate how much your ship weighs in order to determine the fuel needed to blast-off. Write a method that takes in the acceleration due to gravity on Planet X and the weight of your ship on Earth as integers/floats and outputs the weight of your ship on Planet X as integer/float. 

**Remember:**
- acceleration due to gravity on Earth = 9.8
- weight  =  (acc. due to gravity)(mass)

```js
weightOnX(9.8, 20056) ==> 20056
weightOnX(10, 10780) ==> 11000
```
