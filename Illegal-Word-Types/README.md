# Instructions

Write a function that takes in a sentence and an illegal word, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the sentence contains the illegal word. Capitalization should not matter.

**Example**

```js
illegalWord('Hello there', 'fudge') => false
illegalWord("But I didn't say fudge", 'fudge') => true
illegalWord("But I didn't say fudge", 'Fudge') => true
```
